ComplyAdvantage Systems Engineering Task

Pre-requisites if you choose to run code locally:
docker (recommended version >= 17.03.1-ce)
docker-compose (recommended version >= 1.18.0)

Welcome to the ComplyAdvantage Systems Engineering Task! This exercise gives you the opportunity to demonstrate your knowledge and proficiency with Software Development Life Cycle best practices and tooling.

The premise of this assignment is that a member of your team has developed a self-contained Very Exciting Guestbook in Python that requires deployment to a Production Environment so the general public can visit it.

The Guestbook consists of 3 pages:
- a home page where visitors are invited to enter their name and keeps a count of the number of page views
- a submission/'Thanks' page for visitors that have entered their name
- a 'Visitors' page where pervious visitors to the website are listed

Names of visitors to the site are stored in MySQL, and number of page views are stored in redis.

Your team member has also included a docker-compose.yml they used to assist in the development of the Guestbook, and can be used to quickly get the project up and running.

Under the assumption you have administrator access to a Cloud Computing Service Prodiver, your task is to describe the processes you undertake to have the project running in a stable, secure, and scalable manner in the Cloud.

You are encouraged to be as specific as possible with your choice of tooling (if any), as well as critiquing the code itself.
